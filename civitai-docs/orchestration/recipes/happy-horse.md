# Happy-Horse video generation

Alibaba's Happy-Horse video model, served through FAL. The operations below cover the common video workflows: text-to-video, image-to-video, video-to-video editing, and multi-character reference generation. The operation is selected by an explicit `operation` discriminator — fields invalid for that operation are rejected with a `400`.

| `operation` | Versions | Required inputs | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `textToVideo` | v1.0, v1.1 | `prompt` | Generate a clip from a text prompt. |
| `imageToVideo` | v1.0, v1.1 | `image` | Animate a single source image as the first frame. |
| `videoEdit` | **v1.0 only** | `sourceVideo`, `prompt` | Re-paint or restyle an existing clip; optional reference images guide the look. |
| `referenceToVideo` | v1.0, v1.1 | `prompt`, `images` (1–9) | Subject-consistent generation using up to 9 character references. Cite them as `character1`…`character9` in the prompt. |

**Default choice**: `version: "v1.1"`, `resolution: "1080p"`, `duration: 5`. All Happy-Horse jobs exceed the [100-second request timeout](/orchestration/guide/getting-started#_3-poll-if-you-didn-t-wait-inline) — always submit with `wait=0`.

## Versions

`version` selects the model release. **`v1.1` is the latest and recommended for new work.**

| | v1.1 | v1.0 |
|---|---|---|
| Operations | `textToVideo`, `imageToVideo`, `referenceToVideo` | all four (incl. `videoEdit`) |
| `aspectRatio` | `16:9`, `9:16`, `1:1`, `4:3`, `3:4`, `21:9`, `9:21`, `5:4`, `4:5` | `16:9`, `9:16`, `1:1`, `4:3`, `3:4` |
| 1080p cost | 234 Buzz/s (cheaper) | 364 Buzz/s |
| `videoEdit` | not available — use v1.0 | available |

Reach for **v1.0** only when you need `videoEdit`; everything else should use v1.1.

## The request shape

Every Happy-Horse request is a single `videoGen` step on [`SubmitWorkflow`](/orchestration/reference/operations/SubmitWorkflow). Three keys select which leaf schema the rest of the body is validated against:

```json
{
  "$type": "videoGen",
  "input": {
    "engine":    "happyHorse",
    "version":   "v1.1",
    "operation": "textToVideo"
  }
}
```

### Source-media inputs

`videoEdit` accepts `sourceVideo` as either:

* a Civitai AIR URN (`urn:air:…`), or
* a civitai-hosted URL (`image.civitai.com`, orchestrator blob URLs, civitai-managed R2 / B2 / Spaces).

Arbitrary third-party URLs are **not** fetched — requests that pass one are rejected with a `400`. Upload the video to Civitai first and pass the resulting URL. `image`, `images`, and `referenceImages` go through the image pipeline and *do* accept external URLs — only `sourceVideo` has this restriction.

## textToVideo

```http
POST https://orchestration.civitai.com/v2/consumer/workflows?wait=0
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "steps": [{
    "$type": "videoGen",
    "input": {
      "engine": "happyHorse",
      "version": "v1.1",
      "operation": "textToVideo",
      "prompt": "A little girl walking on a road at sunset, cinematic lighting, smooth camera movement",
      "aspectRatio": "16:9",
      "resolution": "1080p",
      "duration": 5
    }
  }]
}
```

## imageToVideo

Pass a single image as the first frame; `prompt` becomes optional and only steers the motion.

```json
{
  "engine": "happyHorse",
  "version": "v1.1",
  "operation": "imageToVideo",
  "prompt": "Camera slowly pushes in",
  "image": "https://image.civitai.com/.../first-frame.jpeg",
  "resolution": "1080p",
  "duration": 5
}
```

`aspectRatio` is **not** accepted here — output dimensions are derived from the input image. Source images must be at least 300px on the short side, ≤20 MB, and within a 1:2.5–2.5:1 aspect range.

## videoEdit

::: tip v1.0 only
`videoEdit` is not part of v1.1 — this operation requires `version: "v1.0"`. Submitting it on v1.1 is rejected with a `400`.
:::

Re-paint or restyle an existing clip. The output duration matches the source; `duration` on the request applies to the cost preview only.

```json
{
  "engine": "happyHorse",
  "version": "v1.0",
  "operation": "videoEdit",
  "prompt": "Repaint the scene in vibrant anime style; reference @Image1 for the character outfit",
  "sourceVideo": "https://image.civitai.com/.../clip.webm",
  "referenceImages": [
    "https://image.civitai.com/.../style.jpeg"
  ],
  "audioSetting": "auto",
  "resolution": "1080p"
}
```

* `referenceImages` is optional — pass 0–5 images. Cite them in the prompt as `@Image1`–`@Image5`.
* `audioSetting`: `"auto"` regenerates a soundtrack to match the edit; `"origin"` keeps the source audio intact.
* FAL bills both the input *and* the output second on this operation, so the per-second rate is double the other modes — see [Cost](#cost).

## referenceToVideo

Generate with 1–9 character references. Cite each in the prompt with `character1`, `character2`, … `character9`.

```json
{
  "engine": "happyHorse",
  "version": "v1.1",
  "operation": "referenceToVideo",
  "prompt": "character1 and character2 walk together through a neon-lit alley",
  "images": [
    "https://image.civitai.com/.../subject-a.jpeg",
    "https://image.civitai.com/.../subject-b.jpeg"
  ],
  "aspectRatio": "16:9",
  "resolution": "1080p",
  "duration": 5
}
```

Reference images must be ≥400 px on the short side and ≤10 MB each.

## Parameters

Shared across operations unless noted. The per-operation schema in the [API reference](/orchestration/reference/) is authoritative.

| Field | Default | Used by | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `engine` | — ✅ | All | `"happyHorse"` |
| `version` | — ✅ | All | `"v1.1"` (latest) or `"v1.0"`. See [Versions](#versions). |
| `operation` | — ✅ | All | See the table above. |
| `prompt` | — ✅ | All (optional on `imageToVideo`) | Up to 2500 characters. |
| `resolution` | `"1080p"` | All | `"720p"` or `"1080p"`. |
| `duration` | `5` | All except `videoEdit`'s (v1.0) output | Integer seconds, 3–15. `videoEdit` clamps output to the source video's length. |
| `aspectRatio` | `"16:9"` | `textToVideo`, `referenceToVideo` | `"16:9"`, `"9:16"`, `"1:1"`, `"4:3"`, `"3:4"` — v1.1 also accepts `"21:9"`, `"9:21"`, `"5:4"`, `"4:5"`. |
| `image` | — ✅ | `imageToVideo` | Single image used as the first frame. |
| `sourceVideo` | — ✅ | `videoEdit` (v1.0) | Civitai-hosted URL or AIR URN — not arbitrary external. |
| `referenceImages[]` | `[]` | `videoEdit` (v1.0) | 0–5 images. |
| `audioSetting` | `"auto"` | `videoEdit` (v1.0) | `"auto"` regenerates audio, `"origin"` preserves it. |
| `images[]` | — ✅ | `referenceToVideo` | 1–9 character references. |
| `seed` | random | All | Integer for reproducibility, 0–2147483647. |

## Cost

Billed per output second in Buzz on the workflow's `transactions`. Use `whatif=true` for an exact preview; see [Payments (Buzz)](/orchestration/guide/submitting-work#payments-buzz) for currency selection.

```
total = buzzPerSecond × duration
```

Rates differ by version — **v1.1 1080p is cheaper** than v1.0.

**v1.1** (`textToVideo`, `imageToVideo`, `referenceToVideo`):

| | 720p | 1080p |
|---|---|---|
| Rate | **182** Buzz/s | **234** Buzz/s |
| Total at `duration: 5` | **910** | **1 170** |

**v1.0**:

| Operation | 720p | 1080p |
|---|---|---|
| `textToVideo`, `imageToVideo`, `referenceToVideo` | **182** Buzz/s | **364** Buzz/s |
| `videoEdit` | **364** Buzz/s | **728** Buzz/s |

Example v1.0 totals at `duration: 5`: **910** / **1 820** (non-edit), **1 820** / **3 640** (`videoEdit`).

`videoEdit` is double the others because FAL bills both the input second and the output second — already encoded in the rate above.

## Reading the result

Same as any `videoGen` step — a single `video` blob:

```json
{
  "status": "succeeded",
  "steps": [{
    "name": "0",
    "$type": "videoGen",
    "status": "succeeded",
    "output": {
      "video": { "id": "blob_...", "url": "https://.../signed.mp4" }
    }
  }]
}
```

Blob URLs are signed and expire — refetch the workflow or call [`GetBlob`](/orchestration/reference/operations/GetBlob) for a fresh URL.

## Long-running jobs

Happy-Horse jobs typically complete in 2–6 minutes (longer for `videoEdit` and 1080p). All exceed the [100-second request timeout](/orchestration/guide/getting-started#_3-poll-if-you-didn-t-wait-inline) — submit with `wait=0` and:

* **Webhooks** (recommended): register a callback with `type: ["workflow:succeeded", "workflow:failed"]` — see [Results & webhooks](/orchestration/guide/results-and-webhooks).
* **Polling**: `GET /v2/consumer/workflows/{workflowId}` on a 10 s → 30 s → 60 s cadence.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `400` with unknown field | Field isn't valid for this `version`/`operation` | Each operation maps to its own typed schema (`HappyHorseV1<Op>Input` for v1.0, `HappyHorseV1_1<Op>Input` for v1.1); check it via [`SubmitWorkflow`](/orchestration/reference/operations/SubmitWorkflow). |
| `400` invalid `operation` `"videoEdit"` | Used `videoEdit` on v1.1 | `videoEdit` exists on v1.0 only — set `version: "v1.0"`. |
| `400` "`sourceVideo` must be a Civitai AIR URN…" | Passed an external URL to `sourceVideo` | Re-upload the video to Civitai and use the resulting URL, or pass a `urn:air:…` URN. |
| `400` "referenceToVideo requires between 1 and 9 reference images" | `images` was empty or had >9 entries | Provide 1–9 images. |
| `400` "videoEdit accepts at most 5 reference images" | `referenceImages` had >5 entries | Trim to 5. |
| Step `failed`, `reason = "no_provider_available"` | FAL queue busy | Retry shortly. |
| Step `failed`, `reason = "blocked"` | Civitai moderation rejected the input or output | Re-prompt with different content. (Happy-Horse jobs always run with FAL's safety checker off; Civitai moderates instead, so there is no knob to disable.) |
