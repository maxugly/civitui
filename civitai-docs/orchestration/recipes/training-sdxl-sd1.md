# SDXL & SD1 LoRA training

Train a Stable Diffusion LoRA on your own image dataset using AI Toolkit. This page covers the two classic SD ecosystems:

| `ecosystem` | Output LoRA usable with | Default price | Native resolution |
|-------------|------------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| `sdxl` | [SDXL image generation](./sdxl) | 500 Buzz | 1024² |
| `sd1` | [SD1 image generation](./sd1) | 500 Buzz | 512² |

Both are the cheapest training ecosystems on the platform — good first pick when iterating on dataset choice or hyperparameters before stepping up to a more expensive model family. SDXL is the better default for new fine-tunes; SD1 is mostly useful when you specifically need a SD 1.5 LoRA (e.g. to deploy onto an existing SD 1.5 product).

## The request shape

Every training request is a single `training` step with an `engine` and `ecosystem` selector:

```json
{
  "$type": "training",
  "input": {
    "engine":    "ai-toolkit",
    "ecosystem": "sdxl"          // sdxl | sd1
  }
}
```

The input shape is shared with the other AI Toolkit ecosystems — see [Common parameters](#common-parameters) below. The fields documented here are the SD-family-specific ones (`model`, `minSnrGamma`, `triggerWord`, default text-encoder behavior).

::: tip Long-running step
Training takes minutes to hours depending on dataset size and `steps`. Always submit with `wait=0` and follow up with polling or a webhook — see [Results & webhooks](/orchestration/guide/results-and-webhooks). The `<RecipeRun>` widgets below preview cost via `whatif=true` so you can see the price without kicking off an actual training run.

## Prerequisites

* A Civitai orchestration token ([Quick start → Prerequisites](/orchestration/guide/getting-started#prerequisites))
* A training-data zip uploaded to a Civitai-reachable URL. Three accepted forms:
  * A signed `https://civitai-delivery-worker-prod.*.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/...` URL
  * A Civitai R2 AIR (e.g. `urn:air:other:other:civitai-r2:civitai-delivery-worker-prod@training-images/.../...zip`)
  * Any HTTPS URL that returns the zip without auth
* An accurate `count` of images in the zip — used for batch sizing

## SDXL

Stable Diffusion XL trains at 1024² and produces a LoRA usable with any SDXL checkpoint. The base checkpoint defaults to `urn:air:sdxl:checkpoint:civitai:101055@128078` (Juggernaut XL); override `model` to train on top of a different SDXL checkpoint.

SDXL-specific fields:

| Field | Default | Range / values | Notes |
|-------|---------|----------------|-------|
| `model` | `urn:air:sdxl:checkpoint:civitai:101055@128078` | Any SDXL `checkpoint` AIR | The base checkpoint your LoRA is trained on top of. |
| `minSnrGamma` | `5` | `0`–`20` | Min-SNR-γ stabilization. `5` is a good default; lower values can speed up convergence on simple subjects. |
| `triggerWord` | *(none)* | string | Optional prompt token that activates the trained LoRA. Recommended for character / style LoRAs. |
| `trainTextEncoder` | `true` | bool | SDXL benefits noticeably from text-encoder training. Disable to halve memory cost at the price of prompt-following quality. |
| `textEncoderLr` | `5e-5` | `0`–`1` | Only used when `trainTextEncoder: true`. |
| `optimizerType` | `adafactor` | see [enum](#common-parameters) | `adafactor` is the SDXL house default; `adamw8bit` works too if you have memory headroom. |

## SD1

Stable Diffusion 1.5 trains at 512² and produces a LoRA usable with any SD1.5 checkpoint. Base checkpoint defaults to `urn:air:sd1:checkpoint:civitai:127227@139180`. Same shape as SDXL with two differences: `optimizerType` defaults to `adamw8bit` (not `adafactor`), and `noiseOffset` defaults to `0` (not `0.1`).

SD1-specific fields are a subset of the SDXL list — same `model` / `minSnrGamma` / `triggerWord` / `trainTextEncoder` / `textEncoderLr`, with these defaults:

| Field | SD1 default | SDXL default |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `optimizerType` | `adamw8bit` | `adafactor` |
| `noiseOffset` | `0` | `0.1` |

## Common parameters {#common-parameters}

These apply to every AI Toolkit training input regardless of ecosystem. Defaults shown are the post-`ApplyDefaults` values for SDXL; some ecosystems override individual defaults (the SD1 / SDXL differences above are the main examples).

| Field | Required | Default | Notes |
|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| `engine` | ✅ | — | Always `ai-toolkit` for these recipes. |
| `ecosystem` | ✅ | — | `sdxl` or `sd1` for this page. |
| `steps` | | `2000` | `1`–`10000`. Total training steps. Primary driver of training length and pricing (see [Cost](#cost)). |
| `epochs` | | `10` | `1`–`20`. Number of saved checkpoints delivered, each separately downloadable. Each adds 10 Buzz of storage (see [Cost](#cost)). |
| `batchSize` | | `1` | Defaults to 1. Raise it up to the ecosystem maximum (**4** for both SDXL and SD1) to train faster at the cost of more GPU memory; a larger batch needs fewer steps. Values above the max are clamped. |
| `continueFrom` | | *(none)* | A previously-trained `urn:air:sdxl:lora:...` / `urn:air:sd1:lora:...` AIR to resume from (see [Continue training](#continue-training)). Must be a LoRA of the same ecosystem. |
| `lr` | | `0.0001` | `0`–`1`. UNet learning rate. `0.0005` is typical for character/style LoRAs on SDXL. |
| `textEncoderLr` | | — | Only used when `trainTextEncoder: true`. SDXL/SD1 default to `5e-5`. |
| `trainTextEncoder` | | `true` (SDXL/SD1) | Train CLIP alongside the diffuser. |
| `lrScheduler` | | `cosine` | `constant`, `constant_with_warmup`, `cosine`, `linear`, `step`. |
| `optimizerType` | | `adafactor` (SDXL) / `adamw8bit` (SD1) | `adamw`, `adamw8bit`, `adam8bit`, `lion`, `lion8bit`, `adafactor`, `adagrad`, `prodigy`, `prodigy8bit`, `automagic`. |
| `networkDim` | | `32` | `1`–`256`. LoRA rank. Higher = more capacity, larger LoRA file. |
| `networkAlpha` | | matches `networkDim` | `1`–`256`. Scales the effective learning rate via `alpha / dim`. |
| `noiseOffset` | | `0.1` (SDXL) / `0` (SD1) | `0`–`1`. Adds noise during training to improve dark/bright sample handling. |
| `flipAugmentation` | | `false` | Random horizontal flips. Useful for symmetric subjects. |
| `shuffleTokens` | | `false` | Randomize caption-tag order. |
| `keepTokens` | | `0` | `0`–`10`. When `shuffleTokens: true`, keep the first N tokens fixed. |
| `triggerWord` | | *(none)* | Activation token recommended for character/style LoRAs. |
| `trainingData.type` | ✅ | — | `zip` (only currently supported type). |
| `trainingData.sourceUrl` | ✅ | — | Signed HTTPS URL or Civitai R2 AIR. |
| `trainingData.count` | ✅ | — | Number of images in the zip. |
| `samples.prompts[]` | | `[]` | Up to a handful of preview prompts rendered at each saved checkpoint with the trained LoRA at strength 1.0. Empty entries are skipped. |
| `samples.negativePrompt` | | *(none)* | Applied to all sample prompts. |
| `samples.cfgScale` | | *(ecosystem default)* | Overrides the CFG / guidance scale used when rendering the preview samples. |
| `samples.strength` | | `1.0` | Trained-LoRA weight applied in the preview samples. |

## Continue training / train further {#continue-training}

To resume from a LoRA you already trained instead of starting from the base checkpoint, set `continueFrom` to that LoRA's AIR. The new run starts from those weights and the new epochs build on top:

```json
{
  "$type": "training",
  "input": {
    "engine": "ai-toolkit",
    "ecosystem": "sdxl",
    "continueFrom": "urn:air:sdxl:lora:civitai:<id>@<version>",
    "steps": 1000
  }
}
```

`continueFrom` must point at a LoRA of the **same ecosystem** as the model being trained (an SDXL LoRA for `ecosystem: "sdxl"`, an SD1 LoRA for `ecosystem: "sd1"`). A mismatched ecosystem is rejected.

## Reading the result

Submitting with `wait=0` returns immediately with `status: processing`. Poll [`GetWorkflow`](/orchestration/reference/operations/GetWorkflow) (or use a webhook — see [Results & webhooks](/orchestration/guide/results-and-webhooks)) until the step settles. A successful step produces an `epochs[]` array where each entry is a saved checkpoint; the number of checkpoints is derived from `steps`. Each entry contains the trained LoRA blob and any sample images:

```json
{
  "status": "succeeded",
  "steps": [{
    "name": "0",
    "$type": "training",
    "status": "succeeded",
    "output": {
      "moderationStatus": "Approved",
      "epochs": [
        {
          "epochNumber": 1,
          "model": { "id": "blob_...", "url": "https://.../epoch_1.safetensors" },
          "samples": [
            { "id": "blob_...", "url": "https://.../sample_0.jpeg" },
            { "id": "blob_...", "url": "https://.../sample_1.jpeg" }
          ]
        },
        { "epochNumber": 2, "model": { "...": "..." }, "samples": [] }
      ]
    }
  }]
}
```

The blob URLs are signed and expire — refetch the workflow or call [`GetBlob`](/orchestration/reference/operations/GetBlob) for a fresh URL when downloading the trained LoRA.

`moderationStatus` reflects safety review of the dataset: `Approved` is the green-light case. `Rejected` means the run was halted because the dataset failed moderation.

## Runtime

Training is highly variable and depends on `steps`. Always use `wait=0`.

| Ecosystem | Per-step wall time (15 imgs, default settings) | Typical full run |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| `sdxl` | ~0.3–0.5 s | 5–15 min for 2000 steps |
| `sd1` | ~0.1–0.2 s | 3–10 min for 4000 steps (SD1 is much faster per step) |

Queue time on busy days can dominate — use the workflow's `events[]` to see when the step actually started.

## Cost

Training is billed per **step** plus a flat per-**epoch** storage surcharge, with a price floor:

```
price = steps × costPerStep + epochs × 10        (rounded)
costPerStep = 0.20   (sdxl and sd1)
floor: never less than 80% of the default-configuration price
```

`epochs` is the number of saved checkpoints delivered (default `10`, range `1`–`20`); each adds 10 Buzz of storage. The default run is **2000 steps / 10 epochs**, which lands the price on the familiar number:

```
2000 × 0.20 + 10 × 10 = 400 + 100 = 500 Buzz
```

The **floor** is 80% of the default price (400 Buzz for both SDXL and SD1) — lowering `steps` or `epochs` can save at most 20%.

Sample-prompt rendering is billed separately at standard SDXL / SD1 image-generation rates. Use `whatif=true` (the default for the **Preview cost** button on the `<RecipeRun>` widgets above) to see the exact pre-flight charge before committing.

| Configuration | Buzz |
|---------------|------|
| SDXL / SD1, default (`steps: 2000`, `epochs: 10`) | 500 + samples |
| SDXL / SD1, `steps: 1000`, `epochs: 10` | 400 + samples (floor) |
| SDXL / SD1, `steps: 2000`, `epochs: 20` | 600 + samples |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| `400` with "steps out of range" | `steps` outside `1`–`10000` | The hard cap is 10000. For longer SD1 runs (rare), submit multiple training workflows and chain them. |
| `400` with "model not found" | `model` URN points at a checkpoint that isn't the right ecosystem (e.g. an SD1 model on `ecosystem: "sdxl"`) | Use a `urn:air:sdxl:checkpoint:...` AIR for SDXL; `urn:air:sd1:checkpoint:...` for SD1. |
| `400` with "trainingData.sourceUrl not reachable" | Signed URL expired, or zip behind auth | R2 signed URLs expire — regenerate. Prefer Civitai R2 AIRs for stable references. |
| `400` with "count mismatch" | `trainingData.count` doesn't match the actual image count in the zip | Inspect the zip contents and update `count`. |
| Step `failed`, output `moderationStatus: "Rejected"` | Dataset failed automated content moderation | Replace flagged images and resubmit. Don't retry the same dataset. |
| Trained LoRA looks under-trained | Too few steps for the dataset | Raise `steps`; or increase `lr`. |
| Trained LoRA overfits / memorizes | Too many steps, dim too high, or alpha = dim with high `lr` | Lower `steps`, drop `networkDim` to 16–24, or set `networkAlpha` to half of `networkDim`. |
