# Flux 1 LoRA training

Train a Flux.1 LoRA on your own image dataset using AI Toolkit. The output LoRA is usable directly in [Flux 1 image generation](./flux1) (sdcpp or Comfy paths).

| `modelVariant` | Base model | Inference characteristics |
|----------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| `dev` (default) | `black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev` | Higher fidelity, ~20–28 sampler steps. Good default for most LoRAs. |
| `schnell` | `black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell` | Faster inference, 4 sampler steps, no CFG. Use when you specifically want a Schnell-targeted LoRA. |

The base checkpoint is fixed by `modelVariant` — there's no `model` field to override. To train on a non-BFL Flux.1 finetune, use the [SDXL & SD1](./training-sdxl-sd1) or [other-image](./training-other-image) ecosystems instead.

::: tip Long-running step
Flux 1 training is the most expensive AI Toolkit image ecosystem (2000 Buzz for the default run) and a typical 2000-step run on a 10-image dataset takes several minutes. Always use `wait=0` and follow up via polling or a webhook — see [Results & webhooks](/orchestration/guide/results-and-webhooks).

## The request shape

```json
{
  "$type": "training",
  "input": {
    "engine":       "ai-toolkit",
    "ecosystem":    "flux1",
    "modelVariant": "dev"        // dev | schnell
  }
}
```

## Prerequisites

* A Civitai orchestration token ([Quick start → Prerequisites](/orchestration/guide/getting-started#prerequisites))
* A training-data zip uploaded to a reachable URL (signed R2 URL, Civitai R2 AIR, or any HTTPS URL)
* An accurate `count` of images in the zip

## Flux 1 dev (default)

Trains on top of `FLUX.1-dev` and produces a LoRA usable with any Flux 1 dev workflow.

## Flux 1 schnell

Trains on top of `FLUX.1-schnell`. Inference uses 4 steps and `cfgScale: 0` — the output LoRA is meant to be used in those conditions.

## Common parameters {#common-parameters}

Shared by both Flux 1 variants. Defaults shown are after `ApplyDefaults`.

| Field | Required | Default | Notes |
|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| `engine` | ✅ | — | Always `ai-toolkit`. |
| `ecosystem` | ✅ | — | Always `flux1` for this page. |
| `modelVariant` | ✅ | — | `dev` or `schnell`. Determines the base checkpoint. |
| `steps` | | `2000` | `1`–`10000`. Total training steps. Primary driver of training length and pricing. |
| `epochs` | | `10` | `1`–`20`. Number of saved checkpoints delivered, each separately downloadable. Each adds 20 Buzz of storage. |
| `batchSize` | | `1` | Fixed at 1 for this ecosystem. |
| `continueFrom` | | *(none)* | A previously-trained `urn:air:flux1:lora:...` AIR to resume from (see [Continue training](#continue-training)). Must be a Flux 1 LoRA. |
| `lr` | | `0.0001` | UNet learning rate. Flux 1 is sensitive to high LRs — keep ≤ `0.0005`. |
| `trainTextEncoder` | | `false` | Flux 1 does not benefit much from text-encoder training. Leave off. |
| `lrScheduler` | | `cosine` | `constant`, `constant_with_warmup`, `cosine`, `linear`, `step`. |
| `optimizerType` | | `adamw8bit` | `adamw`, `adamw8bit`, `adam8bit`, `lion`, `lion8bit`, `adafactor`, `adagrad`, `prodigy`, `prodigy8bit`, `automagic`. |
| `networkDim` | | `16` | `1`–`256`. Flux 1's lower default reflects how compactly Flux LoRAs encode style/character vs. SD-family. |
| `networkAlpha` | | matches `networkDim` | `1`–`256`. |
| `noiseOffset` | | `0` | `0`–`1`. |
| `flipAugmentation` | | `false` | Random horizontal flips. |
| `shuffleTokens` / `keepTokens` | | `false` / `0` | Caption-tag shuffling. |
| `triggerWord` | | *(none)* | Activation token. Recommended for character / style LoRAs. |
| `trainingData.{type, sourceUrl, count}` | ✅ | — | Always `type: "zip"`. |
| `samples.prompts[]` | | `[]` | Preview prompts rendered at each saved checkpoint using the trained LoRA at strength 1.0. |
| `samples.negativePrompt` | | *(none)* | — |
| `samples.cfgScale` | | *(ecosystem default)* | Overrides the CFG / guidance scale used when rendering the preview samples. |
| `samples.strength` | | `1.0` | Trained-LoRA weight applied in the preview samples. |

## Continue training / train further {#continue-training}

To resume from a Flux 1 LoRA you already trained instead of starting from the BFL base, set `continueFrom` to that LoRA's AIR. The new run starts from those weights and the new epochs build on top:

```json
{
  "$type": "training",
  "input": {
    "engine": "ai-toolkit",
    "ecosystem": "flux1",
    "modelVariant": "dev",
    "continueFrom": "urn:air:flux1:lora:civitai:<id>@<version>",
    "steps": 1000
  }
}
```

`continueFrom` must point at a LoRA of the **same ecosystem** (`flux1`) as the model being trained — a mismatched ecosystem is rejected.

## Reading the result

Same envelope as the other training recipes — see [SDXL/SD1 → Reading the result](./training-sdxl-sd1#reading-the-result) for the full shape. The relevant bit:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "moderationStatus": "Approved",
    "epochs": [
      {
        "epochNumber": 1,
        "model": { "id": "blob_...", "url": "https://.../epoch_1.safetensors" },
        "samples": [{ "id": "blob_...", "url": "https://.../sample_0.jpeg" }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `model` blob is your trained LoRA — download it (URLs are signed and expire), or use the blob URL directly with [Flux 1 image generation](./flux1) by referencing its AIR in the `loras` field.

## Runtime

Per-step wall time on a 10-image dataset, default settings:

| Variant | Per-step | 2000-step full run |
|---------|----------|--------------------|
| `dev` | ~0.3–0.7 s | 10–30 min |
| `schnell` | ~0.3–0.7 s | 10–30 min |

Always use `wait=0`.

## Cost

Training is billed per **step** plus a flat per-**epoch** storage surcharge, with a price floor:

```
price = steps × costPerStep + epochs × 20        (rounded)
costPerStep = 0.9   (dev and schnell)
floor: never less than 80% of the default-configuration price
```

`epochs` is the number of saved checkpoints delivered (default `10`, range `1`–`20`); each adds 20 Buzz of storage. The default run is **2000 steps / 10 epochs** → `2000 × 0.9 + 10 × 20 = 1800 + 200 = 2000 Buzz`. The **floor** is 80% of the default price (1600 Buzz).

| Configuration | Buzz |
|---------------|------|
| default (`steps: 2000`, `epochs: 10`) | 2000 + samples |
| `steps: 1000`, `epochs: 10` | 1600 + samples (floor) |
| `steps: 2000`, `epochs: 20` | 2200 + samples (+200 for 10 more checkpoints) |

Sample-prompt rendering is billed separately at the appropriate Flux 1 generation rate. Run with `whatif=true` (the **Preview cost** button on the widgets above) to see the exact pre-flight charge.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| `400` with "modelVariant required" | Missing `modelVariant` field | Set to `"dev"` or `"schnell"`. |
| `400` with "steps out of range" | `steps` outside `1`–`10000` | Cap at 10000. |
| `400` with "trainingData.sourceUrl not reachable" | Signed URL expired | Regenerate. Prefer Civitai R2 AIRs over signed URLs for long-lived references. |
| Trained LoRA underbaked | Too few steps for dataset, or `lr` too low | Raise `steps` to 1500–2500 for character LoRAs; keep `lr` at `0.0001`–`0.0003`. |
| Trained LoRA overfits | Too many steps / too high `networkDim` | Lower `steps`, drop `networkDim` to 8–12. |
| Step `failed`, output `moderationStatus: "Rejected"` | Dataset failed content moderation | Replace flagged images. |
