# MAI Image 2.5 image generation

MAI Image 2.5 is Microsoft's text-to-image model, hosted through FAL. The orchestrator exposes it as a single `engine: "fal"`, `model: "maiImage"`, `operation: "createImage"` entry — text-to-image only, with no editing, seed, or style-reference inputs.

**Default choice for new integrations**: leave `aspectRatio` at `"auto"` and let the model pick a composition-appropriate ratio, or pin one of the eleven supported ratios when you need a specific shape.

## Prerequisites

* A Civitai orchestration token ([Quick start → Prerequisites](/orchestration/guide/getting-started#prerequisites))

## Text-to-image

```http
POST https://orchestration.civitai.com/v2/consumer/workflows?wait=60
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "steps": [{
    "$type": "imageGen",
    "input": {
      "engine": "fal",
      "model": "maiImage",
      "operation": "createImage",
      "prompt": "A photorealistic portrait of a woman with flowers in her hair, golden hour lighting",
      "aspectRatio": "1:1"
    }
  }]
}
```

### Parameters

| Field | Required | Default | Notes |
|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| `prompt` | ✅ | — | 3–5000 characters. Natural-language prompts work well. |
| `aspectRatio` | | `"auto"` | One of `auto` / `21:9` / `16:9` / `3:2` / `4:3` / `5:4` / `1:1` / `4:5` / `3:4` / `2:3` / `9:16`. `auto` lets the model choose. MAI returns a fixed resolution per ratio — no width/height. |
| `quantity` | | `1` | `1`–`4`. MAI bills each image separately; quantities > 1 fan out to parallel FAL calls. |
| `outputFormat` | | `"jpeg"` | `jpeg` / `png` / `webp`. |

MAI Image does **not** accept negative prompts, seeds, LoRAs, style references, or explicit width/height — use the [Krea](./krea), [Qwen](./qwen), or [Flux 2](./flux2) recipes if you need any of those.

## Auto aspect ratio

Omit `aspectRatio` (or set it to `"auto"`) to let MAI choose a ratio that suits the prompt:

```json
{
  "steps": [{
    "$type": "imageGen",
    "input": {
      "engine": "fal",
      "model": "maiImage",
      "operation": "createImage",
      "prompt": "A majestic dragon soaring through clouds at sunset, highly detailed, fantasy art",
      "aspectRatio": "auto"
    }
  }]
}
```

## Batch generation

Set `quantity` up to `4` for multiple images from one step. Each image is a separate FAL call (and a separate charge), run in parallel:

```json
{
  "steps": [{
    "$type": "imageGen",
    "input": {
      "engine": "fal",
      "model": "maiImage",
      "operation": "createImage",
      "prompt": "An astronaut riding a horse on Mars, dramatic lighting",
      "aspectRatio": "9:16",
      "quantity": 4
    }
  }]
}
```

## Reading the result

MAI emits the standard `imageGen` output — an `images[]` array with one entry per `quantity`:

```json
{
  "status": "succeeded",
  "steps": [{
    "name": "0",
    "$type": "imageGen",
    "status": "succeeded",
    "output": {
      "images": [
        { "id": "blob_...", "url": "https://.../signed.jpeg" }
      ]
    }
  }]
}
```

Blob URLs are signed and expire — refetch the workflow or call [`GetBlob`](/orchestration/reference/operations/GetBlob) for a fresh URL.

## Runtime

Single images typically land well inside the `wait=60` long-poll window, so a single `wait=60` POST covers the common case. A `quantity: 4` batch fans out to parallel calls but can still push toward the 100-second request timeout on busy FAL queues — submit those with `wait=0` and poll, or register a webhook.

::: tip Preliminary timings
MAI Image 2.5 is a fresh addition. Treat the wall-time guidance above as preliminary until the model has steady-state fleet capacity, and re-measure after it has been live for ~24 h.

## Cost

Billed in Buzz on the workflow's `transactions`. Use `whatif=true` for an exact preview; see [Payments (Buzz)](/orchestration/guide/submitting-work#payments-buzz) for currency selection.

MAI bills a flat rate per generated image:

```
total = 65 × quantity
```

| Shape | Buzz |
|-------|------|
| Default (`quantity: 1`) | **65** |
| Batch of 4 (`quantity: 4`) | 260 |

Aspect ratio and output format don't affect MAI's Buzz price — the provider charges flat per image.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| `400` with "prompt" length error | Prompt under 3 or over 5000 characters | Keep the prompt within 3–5000 characters. |
| `400` with "aspectRatio must be one of" | Invalid aspect ratio | Pick one of the listed ratios (or `auto`) — MAI doesn't accept width/height. |
| `400` with "quantity" range error | `quantity` outside `1`–`4` | MAI caps batches at 4 images per step. |
| Request timed out (`wait` expired) | Large `quantity` or busy FAL queue | Resubmit with `wait=0` and poll. |
| Step `failed`, `reason = "blocked"` | Prompt hit content moderation | Don't retry the same input — see [Errors & retries → Step-level failures](/orchestration/guide/errors-and-retries#step-level-failures). |
