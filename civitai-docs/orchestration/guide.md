# Introduction

The Civitai Orchestrator is an API for running AI workloads — video generation, image generation, upscaling, transcription, text-to-speech, and more — without managing the underlying infrastructure.

You submit a **workflow**: a small JSON document describing what you want done. The orchestrator:

1. Converts workflow steps into **jobs**
2. Races multiple **providers** (FAL, Google, Bytedance, Civitai workers, and others) to claim each job
3. Streams results back — blobs (images/video/audio), text, or structured output

You get a single contract. The orchestrator handles provider selection, capacity, retries, and capability matching behind it.

## When to use this API

* You want to generate or transform media (video, image, audio, 3D) at scale
* You want provider redundancy without writing provider-specific code
* You want job tracking, webhooks, and resumable workflows out of the box
* You already have an AIR (Civitai resource identifier) and want to run inference against it
