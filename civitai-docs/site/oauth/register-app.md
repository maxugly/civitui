# Registering an OAuth app

OAuth client registration is self-service. Sign in to civitai.com, open
[your account settings](https://civitai.com/user/account), and find the
**OAuth Apps** card. From there you can create new apps, edit their
permissions, and rotate secrets.

The screenshot shows a realistic baseline for any app that lets users
spend their own buzz on AI generation: read their profile, read and write
AI Services, and read their buzz balance.

## Fields

### App name

Shown to users on the consent screen ("**\<App name>** wants to access your
Civitai account"). Pick something users will recognize from your product
surface.

### Description

One sentence shown directly below the name on consent. Tell users what your
app does and where it runs — they're about to grant it access to their
account.

### Redirect URIs

One URI per line. **Exact match** — Civitai will reject any `redirect_uri`
parameter that isn't in this list, character for character. Common patterns:

* One entry per environment (`https://staging.example.com/oauth/callback`,
  `https://app.example.com/oauth/callback`).
* `http://localhost:3000/oauth/callback` for local development. (HTTPS is
  not required for `localhost`; it is required for everything else.)
* A separate callback path if you also support "Sign in with Civitai"
  alongside other providers (e.g. `https://app.example.com` plus
  `https://app.example.com/signin-civitai`).

Changes take effect immediately — no waiting period.

### Permission preset

Drop-down with four bundles for the common cases:

| Preset | Good for |
|---|---|
| **Read Only** | Browsers, dashboards, anything that doesn't write or spend buzz. |
| **Creator** | Apps that upload models / media / articles on the user's behalf. |
| **AI Services** | Generation-focused clients — `AIServicesRead | AIServicesWrite | BuzzRead`. Pair with `UserRead` for "who is this user?" calls. |
| **Full Access** | Power-user tooling. Avoid for general distribution — users will balk. |

Pick **Custom** to mix and match from the permissions grid below the preset.
See [Scopes](./scopes) for the bit-by-bit breakdown.

### Permissions grid

One row per resource category with Read / Write / Delete columns. Civitai
honors the principle of least privilege at consent time — users see the
exact set you request, so asking for less makes your app easier to approve.

::: warning
Don't pre-check Delete unless your app genuinely needs to delete on the
user's behalf. Most apps that "edit" content really just need Write.

### Confidential vs public client

When you create the app, you choose whether it's confidential:

* **Confidential** — your code runs on a server you control. Civitai issues
  you a `client_secret` you must keep private. Required for the
  `client_credentials` grant and for calling `/revoke`.
* **Public** — your code runs on a device (browser, mobile app, desktop)
  you can't trust to keep a secret. No `client_secret` is issued. PKCE alone
  protects the flow.

Pick **confidential** by default if you have a backend; only choose **public**
when you genuinely can't store a secret.

## After you save

Civitai shows you the `client_id` (and `client_secret`, if confidential) on
the success screen. **The secret is shown once.** Copy it into your secret
store immediately — if you lose it, rotate it (see below).

You're ready to run through the [quickstart](./quickstart).

## Rotating the secret

Confidential apps have a **Rotate secret** action in the OAuth Apps card.
Rotating invalidates the old secret immediately, so deploy the new one to
your servers first, then rotate. Issued access and refresh tokens keep
working — only your app's ability to mint new ones or call `/revoke`
breaks until you update your config.

## Deleting an app

Deleting an app cascades:

* All access and refresh tokens issued for the app are invalidated.
* All user consents are removed.
* All audit-log entries are retained (deletion doesn't erase history).

Users can also delete their own consent for your app from their **Connected
Apps** card — same outcome on their tokens, no notification to you.

## Verification

The `isVerified` flag is set by Civitai staff for trusted apps and unlocks
nicer consent-screen treatment (verified badge, fewer warnings). Unverified
apps still work end-to-end — verification is purely a trust-signal layer
for the user.

If you ship a production OAuth integration on Civitai, reach out on the
[Civitai Discord](https://civitai.com/discord) to request verification
once you're ready.
